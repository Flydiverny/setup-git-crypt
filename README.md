# setup-git-crypt

This is a GitHub Action for setting up git-crypt in a GitHub Actions workflow. Git-crypt is a tool for encrypting and decrypting files in a Git repository.
The action will download the source for the git-crypt CLI and build it in runtime, it may also be cached in the tools cache.

## Pre-requisite for self-hosted runners

This action requires openssl and openssl-devel to be installed on your runner (exists by default on github hosted runners).

```
yum install openssl openssl-devel
```


## Usage

To use this action in your workflow, add it as a step in your `.yml` file like this:

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: Flydiverny/setup-git-crypt@v1
        with:
          # Insert any required git-crypt configuration here
```

In this example, the `setup-git-crypt` action is added as a step in the `build` job, and it will be run when the workflow is triggered. The `setup-git-crypt` action will install and configure git-crypt in the environment where the action is running, allowing you to use git-crypt in the rest of your workflow.

You can also use the `with` keyword to pass any required configuration options to the `setup-git-crypt` action. For example, you can use the `key-file` option to specify the path to the key file that should be used for encrypting and decrypting files in your repository.

## Configuration

The `setup-git-crypt` action supports the following configuration options:

- `key-file`: The path to the key file that should be used for encrypting and decrypting files in the repository. This option is required if you want to use git-crypt in your workflow.
